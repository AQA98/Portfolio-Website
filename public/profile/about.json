    "about": "I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Software Engineering from Concordia University and a current student of a Complete DevOps course. With a passion for cloud computing and DevOps, I have hands-on experience with AWS services (EC2, RDS, S3, VPC and more), Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible and CI/CD pipelines. At Gatestone & Co., where I work as a Senior IT Helpdesk, I manage technical issues using VMware, PowerShell, and Azure AD, while improving processes like implementing a self-serve password reset tool. My development experience includes projects utilizing ASP.NET Core, Node / Express.js, and Python. I have also led a capstone project, guiding a team to develop a full-stack web application, and completed various personal and academic projects involving machine learning and big data. I'm eager to leverage my technical skills in DevOps, cloud technologies, and software development to drive innovative solutions.",
